## The minimalist set up to get things going

What is the minimalist set up that we need to get this going? Here are three strategies and workflows:

1. Workflow if I am writing by myself and have a collaborator who will not need to do anything else
2. Workflow if several collaborators are going to write together with some online and some offline writing


### If I am only writing with myself and over various devices

1. I set up an initial article here in Authorea and set up a github repository and work from there I use bibtex for my bibliography management, and the matter ends there.
2. I write partly here and partly on my machine when offline, then commit and sync when I come online.
3. I set up the structure of the article here in Authorea and include the relevant sections that is (abstract, introduction, methods, results, discussion) either as one withint the article or as separate files or sections, then push it to a repository and clone the repository and work from there. My bibliography file resides in biblio.bib, I do not have to worry about layout.md file at this stage, and keep writing. 
4. I can write partly here in Authorea and partly in my computer, then when I am done with a part of the work, I do the commit and push to the github, and then when I open this paper in Authorea, and pull the changes in, the changes are all sitting in here. 
5. I only have to use a text file for my work and markdown. 
6. The figures are all stored in figures folder, the data file can be stored as comma separatd value files, and the analysis can be anything really. All nicely syned in one folder and the folder contains the files that get incrementally changed over time. 

## If I am working with collaborators what could be a minimal set up?

1. I start the Authorea project, and create a github repository and set up the abstract, introduction, methods, discussion, etc
2. My colleagues can come and write it directly here, and nowhere else.
3. I will still need to ask them to export their existing bibliography into a bib file and send me that I can upload here. 
4. Else, they can upload the bib file directly to the folder

## We are a team and we want to work offline online together in our own machines and sync

1. Set up the Authorea project, set up the github sync
2. Everyone uses Markdown and the convention of three level headers, etc
3. Everyone uses git to push changes after they work on their own sections
4. The final document can be fine tuned
