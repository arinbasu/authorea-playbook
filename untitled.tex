\textit{Need for this document} 

This document in the form of playbook is written mostly for my colleagues and students (I usually write preface in all my documents) to quickly get them started on this new format. This is written in Authorea itself so please fork it if you like for yourself and use it. This is not a manual on Authorea and I do not intend to write one, but a playbook of some strategies of writing collaborative texts and publishing quickly and get productive. Authorea can be used as such or can be used in conjunction with other writing tools and reference management software. It is not a tool for online analysis of statistical data, but it is possible to do transparent and open access code writing and storage of codes (this is not yet perfect but can be done). 

\textbf{What I will not cover here:}

\begin{enumerate}
\item How to create account in Authorea etc as these are available from the site itself
\item How to write in markdown or latex (you do not need to write in Latex if you use Authorea it formats it for you)
\end{enumerate}
